Icinga Web 2 PuppetDB module
============================

The main purpose of this module is to provide a PuppetDB import source
for Icinga Director. As of this writing it has not even a GUI or CLI
component, but this may change in future.

To install, please refer to our documentation. [Installation and configuration](doc/01-Installation.md)
Note: Some steps require you to be familiar with Puppet/PuppetDB.
